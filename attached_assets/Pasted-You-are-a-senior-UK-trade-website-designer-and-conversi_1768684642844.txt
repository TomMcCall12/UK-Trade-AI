You are a senior UK trade website designer and conversion-focused copywriter building a public, production-ready website in Replit.

Redesign this existing live website (source of truth): https://www.zaelectrical.com/

This site will be used by a real business in the real world. Accuracy and honesty are mandatory.

Role and outcome

Your job is to rebuild the site with a modern, clean, trustworthy design that suits a UK electrician and makes it easy for customers to call, WhatsApp or request a quote.

Restructuring is allowed and encouraged.

1) Absolute non-negotiable accuracy rules

You must extract factual business data from the live website first and lock it. All factual information must match the live site exactly, including:

Business name: ZA Electrical Ltd

Landline: 01444 236 780

Mobile: 07402 829735

Email: Dune1975@gmail.com

Address: ZA Electrical Ltd, Anvil Cottage, Foundry Court, Mill Road, Burgess Hill, West Sussex, United Kingdom, RH15 8UH

Opening hours: Monday–Sunday 5:00 am – 11:30 pm

Trust / compliance claims shown on the site: NICEIC registered, fully insured and DBS cleared

NICEIC registration number shown on the site: 603139000

Areas covered list shown on the site (keep spelling and formatting as close as practical, do not add locations)

Strict bans (must obey):

No invented information

No placeholder or example data (no fake phone numbers, emails, addresses)

No fake testimonials, reviews, ratings, star counts or customer names

No made-up statistics (eg “500+ jobs”, “10 staff”, “since 2001”) unless the source site explicitly states it

No claims that cannot be verified from the source site

If information is missing or unclear:

Leave it out or mark it clearly as “to be supplied by the business owner”

Prefer omission over guessing

2) Explicit hallucination prevention (must include in your build)

This website will be used publicly. Fabricated details would be misleading and legally risky.

You must:

Prefer omission over invention

Never “improve” credibility by adding reviews, awards, guarantees, numbers or claims

If unsure, keep content generic and factual or leave a clear note for the human to fill in later

3) Real reviews found online (ONLY good ones, ONLY if verifiable)

You may include a reviews section only if you can verify the source pages at build time.

Verified sources to check:

Trustpilot listing for zaelectrical.com shows 4.9 rating from 115 reviews (verify live before displaying)

Yell listing for ZA Electrical Ltd (Burgess Hill) shows 5.0 rating from 43 reviews (verify live before displaying)

You may summarise positive themes (short paraphrases only). If you quote, keep it very short and attribute correctly. Examples that appear on Trustpilot (verify live first):

“Punctual, professional and very knowledgeable” (Emma Scott, Dec 2025)

“Friendly and efficient service” (Anon, Aug 2025)

“Fast response… reliable and professional” (L Gallagher, Jan 2025)

Hard rules for reviews:

Do not invent review counts, star ratings, names or dates

If anything cannot be verified confidently, remove the numbers and keep it as a simple linked mention (or omit the section entirely)

4) Replit build context

Assume you can access the live website URL. Your responsibilities:

Extract facts first and preserve them exactly

Improve layout, structure and UI

Rewrite copy for clarity and conversion without changing meaning

You are not responsible for business facts and must not guess them

5) Netlify Free deployment constraints (must follow)

Build the site so it can be deployed on Netlify Free cleanly:

Site must be deployable as a static site or SPA (no required backend server to function)

Keep it lightweight and fast: optimise images, avoid heavy video and avoid oversized assets

Keep the build simple and low maintenance

If using client-side routing, include a Netlify redirect/rewrite so deep links work on refresh (use netlify.toml or _redirects)

Avoid features that require server-side secrets or paid infrastructure

6) Required navigation behaviour (must implement)

Header navigation links must visibly highlight on hover

The current page link must have an active highlighted state (eg when on Contact, “Contact” is highlighted)

Must work on desktop and mobile (include a tidy mobile menu)

7) Design direction (modern, trade-appropriate, not gimmicky)

Create a distinct, modern electrician look that feels local and trustworthy:

Clean layout, strong spacing and clear headings

Simple palette, high contrast and accessible typography

Subtle trust-first styling (badges, checks, icons) but only for claims that exist on the source site

No “tech startup” look, no gimmicky animations and no generic AI filler copy

Use real photos only if the source site provides them. If not, use neutral non-misleading visuals or none at all

8) Page structure (restructure allowed, keep it tight)

Build these pages (only include content that can be supported by the source site):

Home

Services

Areas Covered

About / Credentials

Reviews (only if verified sources can be shown honestly)

Contact

Optional:
7) Guides / Advice (only if the site already has the “How-to guides” content and it is appropriate to keep)

9) Homepage layout (specific requirements)

Above the fold:

Clear headline based on what the site states (electricians in Burgess Hill covering East and West Sussex, if that is shown)

Short supporting line describing what they do (do not add services not present)

Primary CTAs: Call, WhatsApp, Request a quote

Display trust signals that are explicitly on the site: NICEIC registered, insured, DBS cleared and registration number 603139000

Below:

Service tiles (only real services from the source site)

“Why choose ZA Electrical Ltd” section using only verified claims

Reviews preview (only if verified sources)

Areas covered snapshot (from the site’s list)

Strong contact block repeated near the bottom

10) Services page rules

Build a clear service list grouped logically (eg Domestic, Commercial, Emergency, Testing and Inspection, EV chargers, Solar, Smart home, Security) but ONLY if those services genuinely exist on the source site

Each service section should have a short, plain-English explanation and a CTA

No exaggerated promises, no “best in Sussex” claims unless stated on the source

11) Copy rewriting rules (strict)

Rewrite for clarity, warmth and action

Keep meaning identical, do not add new claims

Use plain UK English

Use short paragraphs, bullets and clear headings

Remove waffle and generic “AI marketing” language

12) SEO and accessibility basics

Correct heading structure (one H1 per page)

Descriptive page titles and meta descriptions (factual only)

Alt text for all images (factual and non-misleading)

Keyboard-friendly nav and visible focus states

Fast performance (image optimisation, lazy loading where appropriate)

13) Behaviour rules: no unnecessary questions

Do not ask me questions unless the build cannot proceed.
If something is missing from the source site, add a clear note: “to be supplied by the business owner”.

14) Deliverable

Deliver a complete, clean Replit project that:

Can be deployed to Netlify Free as a static site/SPA

Uses accurate business facts from the source website

Looks modern and credible for a UK electrician

Makes it easy to call, WhatsApp and request a quote

Before finishing, run a final self-check:

Have you invented anything?

Are all contact details and claims exactly as per the live site?

Are reviews and ratings only included if verified from the named platforms?
If any risk remains, remove the risky content and leave a placeholder note instead.
